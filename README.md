# Social Game Rating App (still in development)
 * A Web app where users could rate and write reviews for games

### Goals
* Create a user interface that could call APIs and game reviews to mongoDB
* Each user could create their own accounts
* Each user would have their own profile that lists all the games they have played as well as their thoughts about them
* Create a leaderboard where the overall top games are listed for everyone to see

### Where we are at
